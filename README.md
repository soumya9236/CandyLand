ABOUT THIS PROJECT
------------------------
This project implements an interactive board game fashioned after the game
CandyLand. The user plays the role of a player in a quest through the CandyLand word.
There are many special tiles that change the game throughout the world as well.
The goal of the game is to be the first player to land at the castle tile on the board.
